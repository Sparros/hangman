# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Description
The Hangman project allows users to play the Hangman game against the computer. The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined word list, and the user attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters. The game provides feedback for each guess, informing the user if the guessed letter is in the word or not. The player has a limited number of attempts (lives) to guess the word correctly.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create an interactive Hangman game to entertain users and improve their word-guessing skills.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to implement a simple game logic using Python. This project also helped me understand user input validation and basic game flow control.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using:

bash

```python 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd hangman
```

Run the game using:

```python 
python hangman.py
```

## Usage
Run the game using the installation instructions provided above.
Enter a letter to guess.
Follow the game prompts to guess the word.
